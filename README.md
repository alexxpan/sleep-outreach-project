# sleep-outreach-project

A website dedicated to educating the public about sleep. It provides basic information about how sleep works, fun facts, and the dangers of not sleeping.

Part of the Psychology 133 (Psychology of Sleep) class, taken Spring 2017. The sleep outreach project is designed to educate the public about sleep, using any medium of communication. Websites are a convenient, accessible way to spread information quickly â€” hence why this site was created!
